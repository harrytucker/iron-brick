#+TITLE: Iron Brick - Lego Tournament Scoreboard
#+AUTHOR: Harry Tucker

* About
Iron Brick is a re-write of the [[https://github.com/harrytucker/lego-scoreboard/][lego-scoreboard]] Flask application using the [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust programming language]]. This is a learning exercise for myself, and an attempt to improve on the previous version of this application, where Rust's typesystem and other features can be exploited to make a robust application.

* Some Technical Details
+ [[https://rocket.rs][Rocket]] provides the web layer of things
+ [[https://serde.rs/][Serde]] is a very powerful serialisation framework that is used to handle missions like the previous application

* Requirements
Rocket 0.4.5 still doesn't compile on stable Rust just yet, so make sure you're running nightly:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
#+END_SRC
Then simply compile the dependencies from `Cargo.toml` as normal:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cargo build
#+END_SRC

* In Progress [0%]
** STRT Implement Web Interface
** TODO Implement CLI for management
** TODO Import and export of JSON/YAML
